Hospitals are now at the forefront for multi-site medical data sharing to provide ground-breaking advancements in the way health records are shared and patients are diagnosed. Sharing of medical data is essential in modern medical research. Yet, as with all data sharing technology, the challenge is to balance improved treatment with protecting patient’s personal information. This paper provides a novel split learning algorithm coined the term, “multi-site split learning”, which enables a secure transfer of medical data between multiple hospitals without fear of exposing personal data contained in patient records. It also explores the effects of varying the number of end-systems and the ratio of data-imbalance on the deep learning performance. A guideline for the most optimal configuration of split learning that ensures privacy of patient data whilst achieving performance is empirically given. We argue the benefits of our multi-site split learning algorithm, especially regarding the privacy preserving factor, using CT scans of COVID-19 patients, X-ray bone scans, and cholesterol level medical data.","tags":null,"title":"Feasibility study of multi-site split learning for privacy-preserving medical systems under data imbalance constraints in COVID-19, X-ray, and cholesterol dataset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Won Joon Yun","Anna Yoo Jeong Ha","Soyi Jung","Joongheon Kim"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633046400,"objectID":"add5a1835f0c2f504f56235ca76ff4d2","permalink":"https://annaha.net/publication/drone-taxi/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/drone-taxi/","section":"publication","summary":"In smart city scenarios, the use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks is one of actively discussed technologies.

However, patient records are one of the most sensitive private information that is not usually shared among institutes. This paper presents spatio-temporal split learning, a distributed deep neural network framework, which is a turning point in allowing collaboration among privacy-sensitive organizations. Our spatio-temporal split learning presents how distributed machine learning can be efficiently conducted with minimal privacy concerns. The proposed split learning consists of a number of clients and a centralized server. Each client has only has one hidden layer, which acts as the privacy-preserving layer, and the centralized server comprises the other hidden layers and the output layer. Since the centralized server does not need to access the training data and trains the deep neural network with parameters received from the privacy-preserving layer, privacy of original data is guaranteed. We have coined the term, spatio-temporal split learning, as multiple clients are spatially distributed to cover diverse datasets from different participants, and we can temporally split the learning process, detaching the privacy preserving layer from the rest of the learning process to minimize privacy breaches. This paper shows how we can analyze the medical data whilst ensuring privacy using our proposed multi-site spatio-temporal split learning algorithm on Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans, MUsculoskeletal RAdiographs (MURA) X-ray images, and cholesterol levels.","tags":null,"title":"Spatio-Temporal Split Learning for Privacy-Preserving Medical Platforms: Case Studies With COVID-19 CT, X-Ray, and Cholesterol Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gusang Lee","Won Joon Yun","Anna Yoo Jeong Ha","Soyi Jung","Jiyeon Kim","Sunghoon Hong","Joongheon Kim","Youn Kyu Lee"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1628985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628985600,"objectID":"8f8120f29881141d12efed66524dd168","permalink":"https://annaha.net/publication/electronics/","publishdate":"2021-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/electronics/","section":"publication","summary":"Experience sharing among multiple users in virtual reality (VR) is one of the key applications in next generation wireless systems. In this VR application, one object can be reproduced as a virtual object based on recorded/captured multiple real-time images from multiple observation points. At this time, VR applications require a lot of bandwidth to provide seamless services to users in wireless links, and thus, a certain level of data rates should be maintained. As the number of users increases, the server allocates more data rates to users on top of the limited bandwidth in wireless networks. At this time, users who utilize the VR streaming services will suffer from a lower quality, due to the limited bandwidth. This paper reports the measurement study and also analyzes the fluctuations in terms of the data rates as the number of users increases while sharing point cloud information in real-time authorized reality environments over IEEE 802.11ac wireless networks. Moreover, it measures and analyzes fluctuations in terms of frames-per-second and Jitters, which are practical quality reduction indicators.","tags":null,"title":"Measurement Study of Real-Time Virtual Reality Contents Streaming over IEEE 802.11ac Wireless Links","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Yoo Jeong Ha","Minjae Yoo","Soohyun Park","Soyi Jung","Joongheon Kim"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"506df68f2358550e4b5411cf6311ddc3","permalink":"https://annaha.net/publication/icufn/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/icufn/","section":"publication","summary":"Personal monitoring devices such as cyclist helmet cameras to record accidents or dash cams to catch collisions have proliferated, with more companies producing smaller and compact recording gadgets. As these devices are becoming a part of citizens' everyday arsenal, concerns over the residents' privacy are progressing. Therefore, this paper presents SASSL, a secure aerial surveillance drone using split learning to classify whether there is a presence of a fire on the streets. This innovative split learning method transfers CCTV footage captured with a drone to a nearby server to run a deep neural network to detect a fire's presence in real-time without exposing the original data. We devise a scenario where surveillance UAVs roam around the suburb, recording any unnatural behavior. The UAV can process the recordings through its on-mobile deep neural network system or transfer the information to a server. Due to resource limitations of mobile UAVs, the UAV does not have the capacity to run an entire deep neural network on its own. This is where the split learning method comes in handy. The UAV runs the deep neural network only up to the first hidden layer and sends only the feature map to the cloud server, where the rest of the deep neural network is processed. By ensuring that the learning process is divided between the UAV and the server, the privacy of raw data is secured while the UAV does not overexert its minimal resources.","tags":null,"title":"Secure aerial surveillance using split learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Yoo Jeong Ha","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
